# REST vs GraphQL
### Summary
RESTful will live together with GraphQL.

_GraphQL is an API._

_GraphQL tries to improve the way clients communicate with remote systems. An Application Programming Interface. As such, it’s a direct replacement for REST._

_GraphQL’s power comes from a simple idea — instead of defining the structure of responses on the server, the flexibility is given to the client._

GraphQL represents a shift **from server-first to client-first**, exactly the current stage of the internet.
